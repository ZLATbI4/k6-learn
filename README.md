# Welcome to the k6-Learn

Want to present about k6 to your company or meetup? This repo contains resources for:
- creating slide presentations
- giving a workshop
- speaking about k6

## Starter slide deck

[Here's a starter slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gviRg7RTzT0Y2_5WPBADyn5xpa96PIqWivGAThNW6pM/edit?usp=sharing) that you can copy, modify to your use case, and present. It is only intended to be a jumping off point, so you can remove slides that wouldn't appeal to your audience or add new ones to show off your style more.

## What if I want something more hands on?
